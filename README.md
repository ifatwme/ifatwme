## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Fatemeh Ghasemi!
+ Thanks for popping by!

- As a curious explorer, and contemplative learner with a focus on Problem analysis, I like read and work on real world problems and their solutions if applicable, meanwhile having fun.
- You may want to also follow me on [GitHub](https://github.com/ifatwme) and [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/YOUR_LINKEDIN_USERNAME) for a great dose of practical educational data science content.
- You can find my portfolio below. Feel free to reach out for a chat on topics common to both of us!
+ **let's connect!**
